AutoHotkey script that:

  1) Remaps Caps Lock to Left Control.
  2) Binds Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right to execute a tool that switches the Windows
  virtual desktop using a stripped down version of Markus Scholtes' 'Virtual
  Desktop' tool.

The virtual desktop switching tool can be build using the `Compile.bat` file,
assuming the Windows machine has the .NET framework installed. All of this
works without requiring administrator privileges on the Windows machine.
